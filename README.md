## Requirements

The project dependencies include 
```
"jsonfile": "^6.0.1",
"path": "^0.12.7"
```

and can be installed by running `npm install .` after cloning the extension repo.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

- Loading the question mappings takes a long time.
